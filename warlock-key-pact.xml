	    <p>Your patron has granted you access to a pocket realm they created. You gain a key of a design resembling that of your patron. You can use this key as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. While you are holding your key, you can spend 1 minute channeling energy into the key to construct a 10 foot tall and 5 foot wide doorway in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. You must have a free hand to construct this doorway, and if you are interrupted you must start the construction again. Once the doorway opens, it remains open until all creatures have exited the realm. A creature can attempt to enter the realm by succeeding a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to your spell save DC. Creatures you designate automatically succeed on this saving throw. A creature can see clearly for 15 feet through the other side of the doorway before it fades into a blur.</p>
      <p class="indent">The environment inside this pocket realm is no larger than a 100-foot cube. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. The first time you create this pocket realm it is outfitted with a bed, a couch, a dresser, a mirror, a light source, a water source, and an icon of your patron. The doorway location on the other side of the realm is selected when you create the doorway.</p>
      <p class="indent">If you lose your key, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous key. The key fades when you die.</p>
      <p class="indent">Once you successfully summon the doorway, you cannot do so again until the doorway closes.</p>
