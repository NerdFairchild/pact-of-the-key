# pact-of-the-key

Hello my fellow yees and haws!

My name is Nerd Fairchild. I'm a very new to this whole coding thing but I'm trying. Also English is my second language so please let me know if you find any grammar mistakes I made so I can fix them.

I made this Pact of the Key pact boon for the warlock class in Dungeons & Dragons 5e because I really liked this idea. Credit to FrostBladestorm who created this wondeful pact boon. You can find the original version here:

I didn't change anything on this version. I just made it possible to use this pact in Aurora Builder too.

I hope you'll like it and please let me know if you find any bugs or something else, so I can fix it.
